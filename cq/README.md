# CAAPT competency questions
Forty-three competency questions have been generated in collaboration with staff at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Five prompts were posed in order to support the identification of the competency questions: 
- What questions come up for you when you are thinking about reviewing catalogue data for problematic terminology?
- What questions come up for you when you encounter what you think might be an instance of problematic terminology in catalogue data?
- What questions come up for you when you seek to engage with problematic terminology in cataloguing data?
- What information, or what kinds of information, do you look for when trying to make a decision about what to do when you encounter what you think may be an instance of problematic terminology in catalogue data?
- Where do you go to try to find information or answers to the questions that you have?
 
The list of questions below corresponds to the SPARQL queries detailed in the [cq_queries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eecanning/caapt/refs/heads/main/cq/cq_queries) file.
