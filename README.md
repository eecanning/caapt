# CAAPT: Computational Approaches for Addressing Problematic Terminology - Ontologies and Vocabulary

The CAAPT Ontologies represent the structure and intellectual contents of terminology guideline documents along with the related work practices of reviewing and potentially editing records as a result of the identification of "problematic terminology" in cultural heritage institutions, with a particular focus on the museum context. It is named for the research project in which it was developed: the AHRC-funded studentship Computational Approaches for Addressing Problematic Terminology in V&A Museum catalogues. The three ontologies for this project - CAAPT-O, CAAPT-UC, and CAAPT-DM - model terms, definitions, suggestions, and actions, drawing on existing ontologies such as CIDOC CRM, OntoLex, CULCO, and the Web Annotation Data Model to represent the key concepts involved in critical cataloguing as defined by domain experts. The vocabulary - CAAPT-V - includes vocabulary concepts for classifying terms, texts, suggestions, senses, and catalogue record field types.

The CAAPT ontologies and vocabulary can be found at the following namespaces: 
- CAAPT-O: https://w3id.org/caapt/ontology
- CAAPT-UC: https://w3id.org/caapt/use-contexts
- CAAPT-DM: https://w3id.org/caapt/decision-making
- CAAPT-V: https://w3id.org/caapt/vocabulary

This research is taking place as part of the AHRC-funded Collaborative Doctoral Partnership scheme grant AH/X004775/1.
